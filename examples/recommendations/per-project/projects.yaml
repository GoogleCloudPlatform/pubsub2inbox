# This example searches for all projects in GCP that have a label called 
# owner. The found projects are then written to a Pub/Sub topic, where
# the recommendations function will pick them up and generate a recommendation
# report per project owner.
#
# The messages sent to Pub/Sub will be JSON encoded project data:
#
# {
#   "projectNumber": "12345678", 
#   "projectId": "project-id", 
#   "lifecycleState": "ACTIVE", 
#   "name": "Project name", 
#   "labels": {"charging-code": "1234567", "owner": "admin"}, 
#   "createTime": "2021-03-01T11:58:51.351Z", 
#   "parent": {"type": "folder", "id": "987654321"}
# }

processors:
  - projects

projects:
  filter: 'lifecycleState:ACTIVE labels.owner:*'
  indexing: projectId
  # You can additionally filter
  #jinjaFilter: |
  #  {% if projectId.startswith('my-prefix') %}1{% endif %}

outputs:
  - type: pubsub
    topic: projects/YOUR-PROJECT/topics/recommendations-report
    messages: |
      {{ projects|json_encode }}
    content: |
      {{ value|json_encode }}
