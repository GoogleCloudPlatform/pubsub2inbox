# This example reads a list of Cloud Identity groups from the API, filters them
# and then submits the group IDs to another Pub/Sub topic (one message per group).
# The other example (groups-example-2.yaml) is meant to be run on the other
# topic, and will fetch the individual group and create a report for it.
#

processors:
  - groups

groups:
  query: "parent=='customers/C0000000' && 'cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum' in labels"
  # Regular expression
  filter: "^your-group-"

outputs:
  - type: pubsub
    # Target Pub/Sub topic
    topic: projects/my-project/topics/group-example
    # By default, Pub/Sub output will create a single message, but by defining a messages
    # configuration, we can create messages for any iterable type.
