# This example shows Directory API called twice, first to retrieve
# all groups and then to retrieve group settings for those groups.
# Then finally, all groups that allow external members are printed
# out.
#
# You could also use Pub/Sub fanout to parallelize the processing
# (see groups-example.yaml)
# 
processors:
  - { processor: directory, config: get_groups }
  - { processor: directory, config: get_group_settings }

get_groups:
  ### Fetching list of groups ###
  api: groups
  domain: example.com
  query: ""
  serviceAccountEmail: service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

get_group_settings:
  ### Fetching list of groups ###
  api: groupsettings
  domain: example.com
  groupUniqueIds: |
    {{ results|map(attribute='email')|list|json_encode }}
  query: ""
  serviceAccountEmail: service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

outputs:
  - type: logger

    message: |
      The following groups allow external members:
