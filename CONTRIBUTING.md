# Contributing

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

The CLA **must be signed using the same account** in the `.gitconfig` file that is
used to commit to the repository. Each commit is checked individually so a single
commit with a different configuration (e.g. `user.email`) can cause a CLA check
failure. If this scenario occurs, [squash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git)
your commits to get rid of the failed check.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
